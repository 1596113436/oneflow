    r"""The interface is consistent with PyTorch.
    The documentation is referenced from:
    https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.normalize.html#torch.nn.functional.normalize
    
    Performs :math:`L_p` normalization of inputs over specified dimension.
    For a tensor input of sizes :math:`(n_0 , ...,n_{dim},...,n_k)` each :math:`n_{dim}`-element vector vv along
    dimension dim is transformed as :

    .. math::	
	â€‹   v = \frac{v}{max(||v||_p, \epsilon )}

    With the default arguments it uses the Euclidean norm over vectors along dimension 11 for normalization.

    Args:
        input (Tensor): input tensor of any shape
        p (float): the exponent value in the norm formulation. Default: 2
        dim (int): the dimension to reduce. Default: 1
        eps (float): small value to avoid division by zero. Default: 1e-12 

    Returns:
        Tensor: the output Tensor.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import oneflow as flow
        
        >>> input = flow.randn(3,4,5)
        >>> output = flow.nn.functional.normalize(input, 1, 2)
        >>> output.shape
        oneflow.Size([3, 4, 5])
